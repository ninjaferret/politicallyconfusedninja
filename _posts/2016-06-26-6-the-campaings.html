<p>The tone of the <em>EU Referendum</em> campaign was unpleasant at times, neither camp seemed to be able to produce a decent, coherent campaign and often ended up making this about internal party squabbles and not about the real issues that needed to be discussed. The general public seemed to want to know more facts but at the same time seemed unwilling to go out and find them or trust what many of the politicians were saying. Why did the campaigns seem so bad? Was it really a battle of <em>Project Fear</em> vs <em>Project Hate</em>? What does this say about our politics and our politicians?</p>
