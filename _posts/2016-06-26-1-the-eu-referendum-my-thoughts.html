<p>Last Thursday (23rd June), the UK held a referendum on whether to remain part of the European Union or to leave and to go it alone as an independent state. Friday morning came and the results were a narrow victory for the <em>Leave</em> campaign, 52% of the country chose to leave the EU.</p>

<p>There is a lot to think about, a lot I have to talk about when it comes to this referendum so I'm going to make a few posts to try to explain my thoughts.</p>

<p>You can probably ignore my post on <a href="/2016/06/26/i-am-very-angry.html" title="My angry rant about the referendum">why I am currently very angry</a> as this is just a rant to help me come to terms with how I am feeling right now.</p>

<h3>What happened?</h3>

<p>I stayed up to watch as the <em>EU Referendum</em> results were coming in. Gibraltar was the first and, as expected, they were highly in favour of <em>Remain</em> because of their strong ties to Spain. It did not really tell us anything, this was what we anticipated, a 96% vote to <em>Remain</em> was exactly what was expected.</p>

<p>Newcastle was the next and the results were disappointing, it was roughly 50:50 and that was not good enough, this was not what the result the analysts expected but this was the first to declare and it could still be an outlier, it would be OK, though I was nervous.</p>

<p>The next few results came in and seemed to shore up the <em>Remain</em> vote then came Sunderland, expected to be a significant support for the <em>Leave</em> campaign and it felt like a bigger vote for <em>Leave</em> than people were predicting.</p>

<p>As the night progressed we saw increasing numbers of results coming in, the key factors seemed to be that <em>Leave</em> was doing better in the areas that they were expected to do well in but <em>Remain</em> was having a mixed night. The turnout was higher in the <em>Leave</em> areas, that was a sign of things to come.</p>

<p>Eventually, <em>Leave</em> were called as the winners... <a href="/20160626/i-am-very-angry.html" title="My angry rant about the referendum">and I was shocked, I was angry</a> and I am writing a lot of this as a way to cope with the emotions that I am feeling.</p>

<h3>Why did we vote to leave?</h3>

<p>I think the <em>EU Referendum</em> has put a spotlight on vast divisions in the country, between regions, between classes and between age groups. My view is that there are a lot of disenfranchised people who do not feel that the current political systems are there to support them and that there is nothing to lose by changing the status quo. I think we need to explore what the potential factors are that lead to such a divided experience of the country, of the <em>European Union</em> and of the world</p>

<p>I think that we can break things down into some useful comparisons:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="" title="My thoughts on how the poverty divide affected the referendum">The poverty divide</a> - Areas doing economically well tended to vote <em>Remain</em> and areas that have been struggling economically tended to vote <em>Leave</em>.</li>
	<li><a href="" title="My thoughts on how the educational divide affected the referendum">The educational divide</a> - Areas with a higher number of graduates tended to vote <em>Remain</em> and areas with low numbers of graduates would vote <em>Leave</em>.</li>
	<li><a href="" title="My thoughts on how the age divide affected the referendum">The age divide</a> - The younger voters had a lower turnout than the older voters, but of those that did vote the younger voters were significantly more <em>Remain</em> and the elderly were significantly <em>Leave</em>.</li>

<h3>Aftermath</h3>

<h4>The economy</h4>

<p>As was expected, in the immediate aftermath of the decision to leave the global markets suffered losses. This is expected as the markets becoming jittery about the future of the UK and its impact on the world economy, we are entering into a period of uncertainty and that will play out in the markets as I think they are going to be a rollercoaster for a while.</p>

<p>I am no market expert but I worry about the decline in the pound, yes, this seems good for exporters but if people are correct and a post-exit clamp-down on immigration increases wages does that not also increase the price of the goods we are exporting? Does this not also mean that we are paying more for everything that we import, effectively importing inflation?</p>

<p>There are rumours that several large banks will have to move staff into EU countries in order to continue trading in those countries, I am sure that there are other companies out there who will suffer. Simple things like hosting costs for start-ups are likely to increase as the main hosting providers are American and Sterling has fallen sharply against the Dollar.</p>

<p>My view is there are no easy fixes for this, we are entering into a period of economic instability driven by the choice of the UK citizens to vote to leave the EU. The quicker we can get to a satisfactory deal, to get politicial stability, the happier the markets will be and the better that will be for the UK.</p>

<h4>Politically</h4>

<p>The country has been left with no leadership at a time when we need it the most. Both the Conservative and the Labour parties are disintegrating into leadership battles and this will only increase the market instability.</p>

<p>David Cameron has given notice that he will resign by October and will not trigger <a href="http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-European-union-and-comments/title-6-final-provisions/137-article-50.html" title="The definition of Article 50">Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty</a> as he believes that it should be the next Prime Minister who will enter into the negotiations and therefore that Prime Minister should decide when to formally decide to leave. Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, and the rest of the Leave campaign, seem to not be in a hurry to trigger <em>Article 50</em> as it appears that they do not really have a plan for what the future would look like post-exit. To be honest, it appears that no one had a plan for what happened post-exit.</p>

<p>It is believed that there is a coup underway within the Labour party to oust Jeremy Corbyn as leader, according to some <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36633238" title="BBC news story reporting that Jeremy Corbyn sabotaged the remain campaign">Jeremy Corbyn sabotaged the Remain campaign</a> because he did not really support membership of the EU. Whether this is true or not he failed to really become a prominent figure in the <em>Remain</em> camp as he made the choice to not share a platform with the Conservative party.</p>

<p>Scotland has an interesting position as it may well have the ability to veto the decision to leave the UK but given the SNP are in power in Scotland there is a high chance that if we trigger <em>Article 50</em> Scotland will demand a new independence referendum and will probably win.</p>

<p>There are significant implications about what happens to Northern Ireland too with people talking about adding border controls between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland and calls by Sinn Fein calling for a referendum on Irish unification.</p>

<p>The political upheaval could tear apart the United Kingdom and worryingly could even tear apart the EU as there are many anti-EU parties like <em>Front National</em> in France led by Marine Le Pen who are also now calling for their own in/out referenda. To protect themselves from the break-up of the EU it is likely that the EU will have to be harsh on the UK, even if it is against their economic interests, to make an example of the United Kingdom.</p>

<h4>Socially</h4>

<p>There is a scary side to post-referendum UK, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/brexit-eu-referendum-racial-racism-abuse-hate-crime-reported-latest-leave-immigration-a7104191.html" title="Independent article on the increase of hate crimes post-referendum">an increase in hate crimes being seen post-referendum</a>.</p>

<p>This was brought home to me as I stood waiting to march in solidarity with my community at <em>Pride - London</em>, when I received a message from a friend who was approached by three thugs telling him "we'll get you out soon" and pushing him around. Since then I have heard of numerous other incidents. <strong>THIS HAS TO STOP!</strong></p>

<p>Throughout this referendum campaign, I have been worried that we are normalising prejudice, we are providing a <em>respectable face of prejudice</em>. I have been worried about this for many years, worried about the language our politicians and our media use to <em>"other"</em> people to drive policy through. Over many years I have been worried about the media scaremongering and outright lying in their headlines (a convenient clarification is posted in a small section deep in the next day's paper) to carefully direct people's anger towards the wrong targets. The language of austerity, the language of this referendum, have made me deeply concerned and so far my fears are coming true.</p>

<p>I truly believe that the majority of people voting <em>Leave</em> did not intend for this to happen but the racists and xenophobes have been empowered by this, they now believe that 52% of the country agrees with them and it emboldens them to take their campaign to the streets, to threaten and terrorise people in our community.</p>

<p>We now, as a country, have to stand up against this aggression and we have to ensure that it does not continue. If you see, or have been affected by racism or xenophobia <a href="https://www.gov.uk/report-hate-crime" title="Government information on reporting hate crimes">report it to the police</a>, we have to have a zero-tolerance approach to this. I will stand by those who feel this country has turned against them, if we all do, if we all stand up to the hate we can stamp it out.</p>
