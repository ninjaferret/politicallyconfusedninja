<p>The older the age group in the <em>EU Referendum</em>, the more likely they were to vote for <em>Leave</em>, and the more likely they were to vote. This means that the older age groups had a disproportionate impact on the <em>EU Referendum</em> result. Many younger people are angry at the older generations, for damaging their future, but many other questions need to be asked. Why do the younger voters not turn out? Why are the older voters more likely to turn out? Why did the generations vote so differently?</p>
